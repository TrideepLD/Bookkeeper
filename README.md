A dynamic web application hosted using Apache Tomcat that displays a webpage to a user, makes use of Java servlets for accessing information, and utilizes mySQL to create, read, update and delete information from a database.

The website's goal is to create a platform for authors to easily publish a book and for readers to access a book using various search functions such as book specific details or tags associated with certain books. 

The project offers the challenge to develop both the front and back end of the application.
